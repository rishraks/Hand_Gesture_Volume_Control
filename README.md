# Hand_Gesture_Volume_Control
This project implements a hand gesture-based volume control system using a webcam. By detecting the distance between the thumb and index finger using MediaPipe and OpenCV, the system adjusts audio volume in real time via Pycaw. It features smooth volume transitions and intuitive control for a seamless user experience.
